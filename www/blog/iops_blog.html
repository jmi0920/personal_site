            <strong>Connected Technology Is Rapidly Increasing</strong>
            <br>
        <p>
            In our society, technology has progressed at a staggering rate. With this advancement a new form of
            technology has emerged, called the 'Internet Of Things' (IoT). The IoT is a new breed of technology where
            everything is connected to the internet and each other. These devices include those used in home automation, entertainment
            devices, and even <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2483488,00.asp">light bulbs</a>. CNBC predicts that by 2020 <a href ="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/11/06/internet-of-things-are-we-nearly-there-yet.html">there will be 50 billion connected devices</a>.
            While the velocity of these devices being developed keeps increasing. It appears that the security behind them has been lacking behind.
            <br>

            <br>

            <br><br>
            With IoT devices being always connected to the internet, that means that the data that they collect is also always being uploaded
            online. If you take into account the amount of data that is also being generated, this means that there is a constant supply
            of information that is constantly being stream and that can be intercepted by opportunistic hackers at any time.

                <strong>The (lack of) Security In New Devices</strong>
                <p>
            A great example of the security and privacy risk that is posed with this technology is with the increased
            popularity in smartwatches. These watches, usually connected to a personal smartphone allows a convenient method of accessing applications, such as texting
            and NFC payments, all without having to actually use a phone.
            <br><br>

            However with this convenience comes a substantial drawback
            in regards to security. In a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_comments/2015/10/00050-98093.pdf">report published by HP</a>
            it was claimed that only 50% of devices offered a method of screen locking and a shocking 70% of smartwatches transmitted
            data without encryption. This means that if someone was standing nearby and using a device to listen for these transmissions,
            they would be able to intercept and steal this data without the user ever knowing. This lack of security implementation for IoT devices
            opens up a higher chance for personal data to be stolen and the increased possibility of identity theft.

                <strong>How To Protect Your Data</strong>
                <br>

                With the constant development of technology pushing for an interconnected world, our privacy and personal data should be one of our largest
                concerns when looking at using technology built upon the Internet of Things. While it may seem that a lot of data can be at risk, there are many steps that
                can be taken to reduce the chance of being subject to data theft. An <a href = "https://www.gearbrain.com/how-protect-your-privacy-data-internet-of-things--1622024544.html">article published by gearbrain</a>
                goes into detail about how to protect data not only on a smart phone, but home networks and smart cars as well.
